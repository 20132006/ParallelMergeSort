    - Install and use the SSH terminal emulator (e.g. Putty)
    - Host Name: ferrari.unist.ac.kr
    - Account / Pwd: refer to BB announcements

1. Complete the unfinished code, mergesort.c

2. $ make

3. Test

    (1) local evaluation

    - In your local machine.

    - run mergesort with 1 arguments. (make sure that the argument is divisible by "p" #proc)

    - $ ./mergesort (number of data to sort)

    (2) cluster evaluation

    - In Ferrari cluster

    - use bash to submit your job to cluster.

    - $ bash submit_jobs.sh

    : After completing, you should get five .e and .o files.

    - You can track your job process by $ qstat

    - When your job is finished, you will get two output files, .e and .o.

    - .e logs the error message and .o logs the output message.
